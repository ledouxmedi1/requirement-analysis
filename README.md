# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting the requirement analysis phase of a hotel booking management system, inspired by platforms like Airbnb and OYO. The purpose is to create a structured blueprint of functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and system architecture diagrams to ensure clarity, alignment with stakeholder expectations, and a solid foundation for software development. By applying industry-standard practices, this project aims to simulate real-world requirement analysis tasks, emphasizing precision, scalability, and user-centric design.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical SDLC phase where stakeholder needs for a hotel booking system are gathered, analyzed, and documented to define what the system does and how it performs. It ensures a shared understanding among customers, hotel managers, and developers, forming the foundation for development.

### Importance
- **Clarity**: Eliminates ambiguity (e.g., defining “fast search” as <200ms response).
- **Scope Control**: Prevents scope creep by setting a clear project scope.
- **Development Guide**: Provides a blueprint for designing and building the system.
- **Cost/Time Accuracy**: Enables precise resource and timeline estimates.
- **Quality**: Aligns the product with user expectations (e.g., reliable bookings).

### Key Activities
1. **Gathering**: Collect needs via interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and document analysis (e.g., reviewing OYO’s system gaps).
2. **Elicitation**: Refine requirements through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping (e.g., mockup of booking interface).
3. **Documentation**: Create SRS, user stories (e.g., “As a customer, I want to filter hotels by price”), and use cases.
4. **Analysis/Modeling**: Prioritize requirements (e.g., MoSCoW), assess feasibility, and model interactions (e.g., use case diagrams).
5. **Validation**: Review with stakeholders, define acceptance criteria, and ensure traceability via an RTM.

### Types of Requirements
- **Functional**: Features like hotel search, booking, and authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0 login).
- **Non-Functional**: Quality attributes like performance (<2s page load), security (AES-256 encryption), scalability (10K concurrent users), usability (WCAG 2.1 AA), and reliability (99.99% uptime).

### Process
1. Gather stakeholder needs (e.g., customers want fast search).
2. Elicit detailed requirements via prototyping or discussions.
3. Document in SRS, user stories, and use cases.
4. Analyze, prioritize, and model requirements.
5. Validate with stakeholders, setting clear acceptance criteria (e.g., “Booking confirmation in <2 minutes”).

### Use Case Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Visualize user-system interactions (e.g., Guest → Search Hotels).
- **Components**: Actors (Guest, Manager) and use cases (Book Property, Manage Listings).
- **Benefits**: Clarify functionalities and improve stakeholder communication.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Purpose**: Define measurable conditions for feature completion (e.g., “Search results load in <200ms”).
- **Benefits**: Ensure quality, guide testing, and align expectations.

This process ensures the hotel booking system is well-defined, scalable, and user-focused, as seen in platforms like Airbnb and OYO.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a cornerstone of successful software development, particularly for complex systems like a hotel booking platform. Below are three key reasons why it is critical in the SDLC, with examples relevant to a hotel booking system:

1. **Prevents Scope Creep and Aligns Stakeholder Expectations**  
   - **Description**: Requirement Analysis defines a clear project scope by documenting stakeholder needs (e.g., customers, hotel managers) and setting boundaries for what is included or excluded. This prevents scope creep, where unplanned features (e.g., adding a chat feature mid-project) derail timelines and budgets.  
   - **Example**: For a hotel booking system, Requirement Analysis ensures the scope is limited to core features like search and booking, with clear acceptance criteria (e.g., “Search results load in <200ms”). Without this, stakeholders might assume additional features like real-time reviews, causing scope creep.  
   - **Impact**: Saves 40-60% of rework costs (per Standish Group) by avoiding misaligned expectations.

2. **Reduces Development Costs and Risks**  
   - **Description**: By providing a detailed blueprint of functional (e.g., booking system) and non-functional (e.g., scalability for 10K users) requirements, Requirement Analysis enables accurate cost, resource, and time estimates. This minimizes costly rework due to misunderstood or incomplete requirements.  
   - **Example**: In a hotel booking system, specifying “API response time <200ms” ensures developers use efficient technologies like Elasticsearch, avoiding performance issues that could cost millions (e.g., 1s delay = 11% conversion loss, per industry data).  
   - **Impact**: Reduces project failure rates, as 50% of failures stem from poor requirements (Standish Group).

3. **Ensures High-Quality User Experience and System Performance**  
   - **Description**: Requirement Analysis defines measurable non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, usability, security) to ensure the system meets user expectations and industry standards. This leads to higher user satisfaction and business success.  
   - **Example**: For a hotel booking system, defining “99.99% uptime” and “WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility” ensures the platform is reliable (like Airbnb’s <52min/year downtime) and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.  
   - **Impact**: Enhances user retention (e.g., 53% of users abandon slow sites, per Google) and avoids legal risks (e.g., GDPR fines up to €20M for security failures).

By establishing a clear, prioritized, and validated set of requirements, Requirement Analysis ensures the hotel booking system is scalable, user-friendly, and aligned with business goals, laying a robust foundation for development.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The following activities are essential for conducting effective Requirement Analysis for a hotel booking system, ensuring stakeholder needs are clearly defined and actionable:

- **Requirement Gathering**:
  - Collect initial stakeholder needs using techniques like interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and document analysis.
  - Example: Interview hotel managers to identify needs like “update room availability in real-time” or survey customers to confirm “80% want price-based hotel filters.”
  - Relevance: For a hotel booking system, gathering needs ensures features like the Hotel Management Service align with manager requirements (e.g., updating listings via a dedicated portal).

- **Requirement Elicitation**:
  - Refine and elaborate requirements through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping to uncover detailed or hidden needs.
  - Example: Create a prototype of the booking interface to validate “users can select check-in/check-out dates” or brainstorm personalized recommendation features.
  - Relevance: Elicitation clarifies vague requests (e.g., “fast search”) into specific requirements like “search results via Elasticsearch in <200ms.”

- **Requirement Documentation**:
  - Document requirements in a structured format, such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), user stories, or use cases.
  - Example: Write a user story: “As a customer, I want to filter hotels by location so I can find nearby options,” or document use cases for booking processes.
  - Relevance: Documentation ensures the Customer Service (Search + Booking) requirements, like payment integration, are clearly defined for developers.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**:
  - Analyze requirements for prioritization (e.g., MoSCoW), assess feasibility, and create models like data flow or use case diagrams to visualize system interactions.
  - Example: Prioritize “booking system” over “loyalty program” and model interactions (e.g., Customer → Book Property) using Draw.io.
  - Relevance: Modeling helps visualize how the Booking Service interacts with Redis and Cassandra for fast, scalable data access.

- **Requirement Validation**:
  - Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, define measurable acceptance criteria, and establish traceability using a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
  - Example: Validate “booking confirmation email sent in <2 minutes” with stakeholders and link it to business needs in the RTM.
  - Relevance: Validation ensures the View Booking Service meets user expectations (e.g., fast access to booking details via Redis cache).

These activities collectively ensure the hotel booking system’s requirements are comprehensive, prioritized, and validated, supporting a scalable and user-centric platform.
